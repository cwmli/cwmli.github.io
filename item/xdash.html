      <h1>Project details</h1>
      <p>Messing around in C# and XNA 4.0. X-DASH became to product of this. X-DASH is unfinished and is more of a prototype than a game.</p>
			<p>The idea was originally a peaceful endless runner type game similar to Sunny Day Sky by Orisnal, but it became a challenge drawing an appealing graphic style and learning the organization behind a game; as a result, I discontinued this project and decided to learn about the basis of game engines, starting with OPENGL.</p>
