      <p>Python game made with pygame. My first programming project. 2D platform shooter, imitation of Super Crate Box.</p>
      <h3>Date:</h3><div>2013</div>
			<h3>Introduction:</h3>
			<p>The land of Stike was a peaceful place, where everyone could have a sense of safety when they step out their humble houses.
				 Not only was it peaceful, but almost everything was given to them, even power. But this power did not mean the literal meaning of power.
				 It was in the form of hats, of which, had inner energy radiating from them. These small hats gave life to the land of Stike.
				 The hats did not come from nowhere of course, It was provided by an ancient artifact, known as the powerhat, which every now and then, generated and spawned one in a random surround location.
				 The powerhat had always been in possesion of the habitants of Stike, until one day......Help the pixel character through his journey of defeating the great Hatnabber and reclaiming the stolen powerhat!</p>
			<p>This game was coded and created in python with pygame. Glitches and bugs may arise.</p>
